Simple setup for most of my projects that contains:

1. Azure storage, Sendgrid, Twilio APIs set up;
2. Simple way of creating, editing, deleting users;
3. Protected way of login functionality;
4. HTTPS redirection;
5. Small function library that helps working with clients from different countries and timezones;
6. A bunch of other small things that make my life easier.
